# PACKET-GPU
An example of running Jupyter Notebook on Packet's Ubuntu 16.04 LTS server using [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) for reverse-proxy, [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) for SSL, [no-ip](https://www.noip.com/) for hostname.

This repo provides several scripts to follow.

## Prerequisites

1. Make sure to have a Ubuntu 16.04 LTS server available with appropriate IPv4 address.
2. Point your host/domain name to the server's IPv4 address. Using [no-ip](https://www.noip.com/) to get a hostname is suggested.
